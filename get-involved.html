                entities that work towards addressing various social, environmental, or humanitarian issues. 
                Here are some ways to get involved in an NGO</p>

                direct service, administrative support, fundraising, advocacy, or online assistance, your time and skills can have a 
                positive impact. By volunteering, you help the NGO fulfill its mission, support the community, and create a better world.

                experience. To get started, research NGOs that resonate with your interests, inquire about volunteer opportunities, and
